      Roar of the Jungle Dragon

    </h2>

<h4 class="text">

	The enemy ascended beyond your control
	Or was that all your intention?
	They have managed to demolish whatever we made
	But you're failing to comprehend
  <br>
	<br>

	If they can, they will easily butcher you whole
	While you're blinded by your depression
	I have gotten to the point where I'm just too afraid
	That you're going to meet your end
	<br>
	<br>

	My screams echo out through the fire
	And your rival dares stand in my way
	Yes, this is a hardship most dire
	And one day, you will heed what I say
	<br>
	<br>

	This is my message to my master
	This is a fight you cannot win
	I think that past your great disasters
	Their victory stirs below your skin
	<br>
	<br>

	If you proceed, I will not blame you
	I will move forth and win your war
	But if I should die before you continue
	You shall have heard my final dying roar
	<br>
